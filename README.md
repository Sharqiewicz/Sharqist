# Sharqist

The inspiration behind creating this tool stemmed from my tendency to overlook adding completed features and tasks to my timesheet, leading to significant time spent at the end of each month trying to recall my activities. Additionally, I sought a solution that would provide a checklist to ensure that my current code adheres to best practices.

Introducing Sharqist, the ideal task management tool designed specifically for programmers in their workplace. It not only assists in organizing tasks and tracking their history but also promotes adherence to clean code practices, facilitates the maintenance of a tidy Git history, supports the creation of pristine merge requests, and ensures the security of web applications.

### Technology

For the implementation of Sharqist, I opted for Tauri. This decision was driven by my desire to initiate my acquaintance with Rust, a technology I am actively cultivating expertise in as part of my journey into blockchain development.
